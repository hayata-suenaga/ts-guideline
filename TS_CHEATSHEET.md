You're correct, and I apologize for the oversight. The section 1.3 also uses two anchor tags in the same way as sections 1.1 and 1.2. If the links are working correctly for 1.3, but not for 1.1 and 1.2, it seems the issue is not related to the use of multiple anchor tags.

One potential reason could be that the anchor tag names for sections 1.1 and 1.2 ("children-prop" and "forwardRef") might be conflicting with some pre-existing identifiers in the environment where your markdown is being rendered.

If you're using GitHub, for instance, it automatically creates linkable headers where the link ID is a sanitized version of the header text, as I previously mentioned. The link ID is made by converting the text to lowercase, replacing spaces with hyphens, and removing special characters. It's possible that the "children-prop" and "forwardRef" identifiers are conflicting with these auto-generated header link IDs.

<a name="children-prop"></a><a name="1.1"></a>

- [1.1](#children-prop) **`props.children`**

  ```tsx
  type WrapperComponentProps = {
    children?: React.ReactNode;
  };

  function WrapperComponent({ children }: Props) {
    return <View>{children}</View>;
  }

  function App() {
    return (
      <WrapperComponent>
        <View />
      </WrapperComponent>
    );
  }
  ```

<a name="forwardRef"></a><a name="1.2"></a>

- [1.2](#forwardRef) **`forwardRef`**

  ```ts
  import { forwardRef, useRef, ReactNode } from "react";
  import { TextInput, View } from "react-native";

  export type CustomButtonProps = {
    label: string;
    children?: ReactNode;
  };

  const CustomTextInput = forwardRef<TextInput, CustomButtonProps>(
    (props, ref) => {
      return (
        <View>
          <TextInput ref={ref} />
          {props.children}
        </View>
      );
    }
  );

  function ParentComponent() {
    const ref = useRef<TextInput>;
    return <CustomTextInput ref={ref} label="Press me" />;
  }
  ```

<a name="animated-style"></a><a name="1.3"></a>

- [1.3](#animated-style) **Animated styles**

  ```ts
  import {useRef} from 'react';
  import {Animated, StyleProp, ViewStyle} from 'react-native';

  type MyComponentProps = {
      style?: Animated.WithAnimatedValue<StyleProp<ViewStyle>>;
  };

  function MyComponent({ style }: Props) {
      return <Animated.View style={style} />;
  }

  function MyComponent() {
      const anim = useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current;
      return <Component style={{opacity: anim.interpolate({...})}} />;
  }
  ```

<a name="style-props"></a><a name="1.4"></a>

- [1.4](#style-props) **Style Props**

  Use `StyleProp<T>` to type style props. For pass-through style props, use types exported from `react-native` for the type parameter (e.g. `ViewStyle`).

  ```tsx
  import { StyleProp, ViewStyle, TextStyle, ImageStyle } from "react-native";

  type MyComponentProps = {
    containerStyle?: StyleProp<ViewStyle>;
    textStyle?: StyleProp<TextStyle>;
    imageStyle?: StyleProp<ImageStyle>;
  };

  function MyComponentProps({ containerStyle, textStyle, imageStyle }: MyComponentProps) = {
    <View style={containerStyle}>
        <Text style={textStyle}>Sample Image</Text>
        <Image style={imageStyle} src={'https://sample.com/image.png'} />
    </View>
  }
  ```

<a name="render-prop"></a><a name="1.5"></a>

- [1.5](#render-prop) **Render Prop**

  ```tsx
  type ParentComponentProps = {
    children: (label: string) => React.ReactNode;
  };

  function ParentComponent({ children }: ParentComponentProps) {
    return children("String being injected");
  }

  function App() {
    return (
      <ParentComponent>
        {(label) => (
          <View>
            <Text>{label}</Text>
          </View>
        )}
      </ParentComponent>
    );
  }
  ```

<a name="type-narrowing"></a><a name="1.6"></a>

- [1.6](#type-narrowing) **Type Narrowing** Narrow types down using `typeof` or custom type guards.

  ```ts
  type Manager = {
    role: "manager";
    team: string;
  };

  type Engineer = {
    role: "engineer";
    language: "ts" | "js" | "php";
  };

  function introduce(employee: Manager | Engineer) {
    console.log(employee.team); // TypeScript errors: Property 'team' does not exist on type 'Manager | Engineer'.

    if (employee.role === "manager") {
      console.log(`I manage ${employee.team}`); // employee: Manager
    } else {
      console.log(`I write ${employee.language}`); // employee: Engineer
    }
  }
  ```

  In the above code, type narrowing is used to determine whether an employee object is a Manager or an Engineer based on the role property, allowing safe access to the `team` property for managers and the `language` property for engineers.

  We can also create a custom type guard function.

  ```ts
  function isManager(employee: Manager | Engineer): employee is Manager {
    return employee.role === "manager";
  }

  function introduce(employee: Manager | Engineer) {
    if (isManager(employee)) {
      console.log(`I manage ${employee.team}`); // employee: Manager
    }
  }
  ```

  In the above code, `employee is Manager` is a [type predicate](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates). It means that the return type of `isManager` is a `boolean` that indicates whether a value passed to the function is of a certain type (e.g. `Manager`).

<a name="try-catch-clauses"></a><a name="1.7"></a>

- [1.7](#try-catch-clauses) **Error in Try-Catch Clauses**

  Errors in try/catch clauses are inferred as `unknown`. If the error dat needs to be accessed, the type of the error needs to be checked and narrowed down.

  ```ts
  try {
      ....
  } catch (e) { // `e` is `unknown`.
      if (e instanceof Error) {
          // you can access properties on Error
          console.error(e.message);
      }
  }
  ```

<a name="const-assertion"></a><a name="1.8"></a>

- [1.8](#const-assersion) **Use const assertions for rigorous typing**

  Use `as const` when you want to ensure that the types and values are as exact as possible and prevent unwanted mutations.

  ```ts
  const greeting1 = "hello"; // type: string
  const greeting2 = "goodbye" as const; // type: "goodbye"

  const person1 = { name: "Alice", age: 20 }; // type: { name: string, age: number }
  const person2 = { name: "Bob", age: 30 } as const; // type: { readonly name: "Bob", readonly age; 30 }

  const array1 = ["hello", 1]; // type: (string | number)[]
  const array2 = ["goodbye", 2]; // type: readonly ["goodbye", 2]
  ```
